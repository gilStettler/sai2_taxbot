# TaxBot Bern – AI-Powered Tax Assistant

**TaxBot Bern** is a lightweight AI chatbot designed to help users based in the canton of Bern, Switzerland, in filling out their tax declaration.
It uses the **OpenAI Responses API** with gpt-4.1 and a **vector store** to answer questions based on official tax documents.

This project was created as part of the Innovation through Generative AI (SAI2) module at Bern University of Applied Sciences.

## 🤯 Troubleshooting
The following problems were discovered while testing our chatbot:
- Using the WLAN "BFH_brue" may lead to not receiving any responses. We therefore suggest using another connection.
- If the Bot gets stuck with generation - indicated by a never ending "Denke nach..." - try to send your last message again.

If you encounter any other issues, pls feel free to contact the owner of the repository directly :)
